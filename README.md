CS457 Database Presentation

	Created with Reveal.js and(partly Adobe Animate CC, only for the canvas animations)
	Html5 support required to display it.
	
	Something is wrong with the canvas... Its height sometimes appears to be too large for its container aka the slide(section)!
	Maybe because I set the width & height in the html file(But I have to otherwise its context size will mess up).
